title: Using Conductor in a Composer project
---

If you haven't already, make sure to [set up authentication](composer-authentication) for your Composer installation.

To start using your Conductor registry in a Composer project, you'll need to add some configuration to the
`composer.json` file, or specify it as a command line option when creating new projects. The examples on this page
also disable fetching from Packagist directly.

**Note that projects using Composer 1 are not supported by Conductor.**

## New projects

### composer init

```shell
composer init --repository="{{ app.request.getSchemeAndHttpHost() }}" --repository='{"packagist.org": false}'
```

### composer create-project

```shell
composer create-project acme/website --add-repository --repository="{{ app.request.getSchemeAndHttpHost() }}" --repository='{"packagist.org": false}'
```

## Existing projects

You can enable the Conductor registry on existing Composer projects by using the Composer CLI or by editing
`composer.json` directly.

### composer config

```shell
composer config repositories.{{ conductor.slug }} composer {{ app.request.getSchemeAndHttpHost() }}
composer config repositories.packagist.org false
```

### Manually editing composer.json

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {"type": "composer", "url": ""},
        {"packagist.org": false}
    ]
}
```
