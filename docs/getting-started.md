# Getting Started with Conductor

Make sure you've followed the [installation][docs-install] guide before continuing.

## Create an Owner account

When accessing the login page of Conductor for the first time, you'll be redirected to the registration page (even if
registration is disabled). The first account created automatically gets an Owner role in the application.
